## Description

Fw-fanctrl is a simple Python CLI service that controls Framework Laptop's fan(s)
speed according to a configurable speed/temperature curve.

Its default strategy aims for very quiet fan operation, but you can choose amongst the other provided strategies, or
easily configure your own for a different comfort/performance trade-off.

It also is possible to assign separate strategies depending on whether the laptop is charging or discharging.

Under the hood, it uses [ectool](https://gitlab.howett.net/DHowett/ectool)
to change parameters in Framework's embedded controller (EC).

It is compatible with all 13" and 16" models, both AMD/Intel CPUs, with or without a discrete GPU.

If the service is paused or stopped, the fans will revert to their default behaviour.

## Installation

### Requirements

| name   | version | url                                                                  |

| Python | 3.12.x  | [https://www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads) |

### Dependencies

Dependencies are downloaded and installed automatically, but can be excluded from the installation script if you wish to
do this manually.

| name           | version   | url                                                                                  | exclusion argument |

### Instructions

First, make sure that you have disabled secure boot in your BIOS/UEFI settings.
(more details on why [here](https://www.howett.net/posts/2021-12-framework-ec/#using-fw-ectool))

[Download the repo](https://github.com/TamtamHero/fw-fanctrl/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it manually, or
download/clone it with the appropriate tools:

```shell
git clone "https://github.com/TamtamHero/fw-fanctrl.git"
```

```shell
curl -L "https://github.com/TamtamHero/fw-fanctrl/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" -o "./fw-fanctrl.zip" && unzip "./fw-fanctrl.zip" -d "./fw-fanctrl" && rm -rf "./fw-fanctrl.zip"
```

Then run the installation script with administrator privileges

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

You can add a number of arguments to the installation command to suit your needs

| argument                                                                        | description                                        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `--dest-dir <installation destination directory (defaults to /)>`               | specify an installation destination directory      |
| `--prefix-dir <installation prefix directory (defaults to /usr)>`               | specify an installation prefix directory           |
| `--sysconf-dir <system configuration destination directory (defaults to /etc)>` | specify a default configuration directory          |
| `--no-ectool`                                                                   | disable ectool installation and service activation |
| `--no-post-install`                                                             | disable post-install process                       |
| `--no-pre-uninstall`                                                            | disable pre-uninstall process                      |

## Update

To update, you can download or pull the appropriate branch from this repository, and run the installation script again.

## Uninstall

To uninstall, run the installation script with the `--remove` argument, as well as other
corresponding [arguments if necessary](#instructions)

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --remove
```

## Configuration

After installation, you will find the configuration file in the following location:

`/etc/fw-fanctrl/config.json`

If you have modified the `dest-dir` or `sysconf-dir`, here is the corresponding pattern

`[dest-dir(/)][sysconf-dir(/etc)]/fw-fanctrl/config.json`

It contains a list of strategies, ranked from the quietest to loudest, as well as the default and discharging
strategies.

For example, one could use a lower fan speed strategy on discharging to optimise battery life (- noise, + heat),
and a high fan speed strategy on AC (+ noise, - heat).

You can add or edit strategies, and if you think you have one that deserves to be shared, feel free to make a PR to this
repo :)

### Default strategy

The default strategy is the one used when the service is started.

It can be changed by replacing the value of the `defaultStrategy` field with one of the strategies present in the
configuration.

```json
"defaultStrategy": "[STRATEGY NAME]"
```

### Charging/Discharging strategies

The discharging strategy is the one that will be used when the laptop is not on AC,
Otherwise the default strategy is used.

It can be changed by replacing the value of the `strategyOnDischarging` field with one of the strategies present in the
configuration.

```json
"strategyOnDischarging": "[STRATEGY NAME]"
```

This is optional and can be left empty to have the same strategy at all times.

### Editing strategies

Strategies can be configured with the following parameters:

> **SpeedCurve**:
>
> It is represented by the curve points for `f(temperature) = fan(s) speed`.
>
> ```json
> "speedCurve": [
>     { "temp": [TEMPERATURE POINT], "speed": [PERCENTAGE SPEED] },
>     ...
> ]
> ```
>
> `fw-fanctrl` measures the CPU temperature, calculates a moving average of it, and then finds an appropriate `fan speed`
> value by interpolating on the curve.

> **FanSpeedUpdateFrequency**:
>
> It is the interval in seconds between fan speed calculations.
>
> ```json
> "fanSpeedUpdateFrequency": [UPDATE FREQUENCY]
> ```
>
> This is for comfort, otherwise the speed will change too often, which is noticeable and annoying, especially at low
> speed.
>
> For a more responsive fan, you can reduce this setting.
>
> **Defaults to 5 seconds.** (minimum 1)

> **MovingAverageInterval**:
>
> It is the number of seconds over which the moving average of temperature is calculated.
>
> ```json
> "movingAverageInterval": [AVERAGING INTERVAL]
> ```
>
> Increase it, and the fan speed changes more gradually. Lower it, and it becomes more responsive.
>
> **Defaults to 20 seconds.** (minimum 1)

Once the configuration has been changed, you must reload it with the following command

```bash
fw-fanctrl --reload
```

## Commands

Here is a list of commands used to interact with the service.

The commands in the `run` context are used launch the service manually.
If you have installed it correctly, the systemd `fw-fanctrl.service` service will do this for you, so you probably will
never need them.
